  honest and intellectual. They are spontaneous and fun, usually with a lot of friends, and are perhaps the best conversationalists
  in the zodiac (maybe tied with Gemini).They tend to inspire the people around them to live their best lives, like a cross between Oprah and Santa Claus.</pre>

 Gemini is constantly juggling a variety of passions, hobbies, careers, and friend groups. They are the social butterflies of the zodiac:
 These quick-witted twins can talk to anyone about anything. Find them buzzing between happy hours, dinner parties, and dance floors.</pre>

   a symbol of the Gods bringing nourishment to Earth. People born under the Aquarius sign are said to be progressive,
   independent, intelligent, unique, and idealistic.Their elemental sign is air, the same as that for Gemini and Libra.Finally, 
   being an Aquarius usually means being original and a little eccentric. It's not uncommon for Aquarians to embrace their 
   creativity and uniqueness, even if it makes them stand out from others in a slightly odd or unconventional way</pre>
