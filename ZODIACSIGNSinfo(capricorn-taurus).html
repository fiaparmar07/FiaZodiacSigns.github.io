   Like fellow water signs, Cancer and Pisces, Scorpio is extremely clairvoyant and intuitive. Life is a game of chess for these calculating water signs, 
   who are constantly plotting several steps ahead in order to orchestrate an eventual checkmate. This doesn't mean their intentions are necessarily nefarious.
   Scorpios simply know what they want and aren't afraid to work hard and play the long game to get it.</pre>

 You can be vague and escapist, but make up for it by being compassionate and intuitive. Self-care doesn’t always come naturally to you,
 but it’s incredibly important.</pre>
